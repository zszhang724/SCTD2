"Sonar Small Target Dataset (e.g., shrimp traps, etc.), formatted in COCO."
"This is a sonar small target image dataset obtained using Klein side-scan sonar. The image size is 320*320 and can be used for sonar image segmentation and detection tasks."
"After decompressing the two zip files, you can obtain five subfolders: Annotations, ImageSets, JPEGImages, SegmentationClass, and SegmentationClassAug. These have been manually annotated for image segmentation tasks. If you want to perform object detection tasks, please re-annotate the images."
